The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results if not fully understood. For example, consider the following scenario:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```

A `<p>` element inside a `<div>` element will be green due to the higher specificity of `div p`. However, adding an inline style with `!important` can override this:

```html
<div>
  <p style="color: yellow !important;">This text is yellow.</p>
</div>
```

The `!important` flag increases the specificity to an extent that overrides other selectors, sometimes unintentionally, making debugging more difficult.  Overuse of `!important` makes CSS harder to maintain and understand.
