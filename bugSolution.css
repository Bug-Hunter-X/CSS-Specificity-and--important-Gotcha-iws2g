The solution focuses on avoiding the use of `!important` by improving CSS selector specificity:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
div p {
  color: green;
}

div p.highlight {
  color: yellow; /* More specific selector for overriding */
}
```

This approach uses more specific selectors to achieve the same styling without using the `!important` flag. This improves CSS maintainability and makes the code easier to understand and debug.  In this solution, a class `.highlight` has been added to the paragraph in the HTML to demonstrate the use of a more specific selector.
