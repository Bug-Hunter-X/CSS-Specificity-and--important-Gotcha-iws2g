# CSS Specificity and `!important` Issue

This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue related to specificity and the use of the `!important` flag.  The problem arises when unexpected styling occurs due to conflicting selectors and the overriding power of `!important`. 

## Problem Description

The `bug.css` file contains CSS rules that illustrate how specificity can lead to unexpected behavior. The `!important` flag is used in an inline style within the HTML to demonstrate its override capabilities, potentially causing unexpected styling and making debugging more complex. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file suggests alternative approaches to resolve the styling conflicts. Instead of using `!important`, better organization of CSS selectors and the use of more specific selectors are demonstrated to achieve the desired styling without relying on `!important`.
